            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Why is the app not detecting my AirPods?</h4>
                <p>Ensure your AirPods are connected to your iPhone via Bluetooth and that you are wearing them. The app
                    requires compatible headphones (AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, or AirPods 3rd Gen) to access motion data.
                </p>

                <h4>I don't hear any alerts.</h4>
                <p>Make sure your device volume is turned up and that "Silent Mode" is not completely muting media
                    audio. You can also adjust the posture sensitivity slider in the app if it's too lenient.</p>
