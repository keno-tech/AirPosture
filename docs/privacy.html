            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last updated: February 17, 2026</strong></p>

            <p>AirPosture ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
                how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.</p>

            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
            <p>AirPosture operates entirely locally on your device. We do not require you to create an account, and we
                do not track your usage.</p>

            <h3>2. Motion Data</h3>
            <p>Our app uses the motion sensors in your AirPods (via Apple's CoreMotion framework) to detect your head
                capabilities (pitch, roll, and yaw). This data is processed in real-time on your device solely for the
                purpose of detecting your posture. <strong>This motion data is never saved, transmitted, or shared with
                    any third parties.</strong></p>

            <h3>3. Audio</h3>
            <p>AirPosture uses your device's audio system to play alerts. We do not record audio from your microphone.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The app does not use any third-party analytics or advertising services.</p>

            <h3>5. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <a
